## Project: Landing Page / The Odin Project
<br>

**Summary**

In this project, I built a landing page based on a design provided from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) shown below. I utilized the HTML, CSS, Chrome DevTools skills acquired through the course, as well as the methods learned from online search. The project details can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). 

The major challenges I encountered in the project: 
 * Building layouts using Flexbox
 * Tackling the white spaces caused by default setting
 * Considering CSS specificity 
 * Naming of the class selectors 
 * Writing code with simplification in mind
 * Git commit message writing
<br>
